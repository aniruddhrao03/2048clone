------
This game is a clone of the classic 2048 game. The game 2048 is played on a 4x4 square grid with numbered tiles that slide smoothly when the four arrow keys are used to move them. When you slide, a new tile will appear in an empty space on the board at random. Tiles slide as far as they can in the chosen direction before being stopped by another tile or the grid's edge. If two tiles with the same number clash while travelling, they will merge into a single tile with the entire value of the two colliding tiles. In the same move, the resulting tile cannot merge with another tile. Has the ability to start a new game right now, and I'll be adding a score counter later.
